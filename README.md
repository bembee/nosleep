# nosleep
You should run this, if you have problems with your PC turn off the screen or going to sleep automatically. It works by press F15 key every minutes, so your machine thinks you're still working at the keyboard, it won't lock the screen or activate the screensaver, Teams never goes to "away" etc.

## System Req
At least Windows 7 SP1 with powershell
